## Accomplishments
* Established accurate LiDAR-based 3D Object detection using VoxelNet DNN architecture, achieving over 89.60% AP, by stacking feature-encoding layers, 3D CNN middle layers, and RPN of regional proposal for integration of robotic systems.
* Evaluated 1000+ images for 15 epochs resulting in an Intersection over Union (IoU) above 70%, indicating accurate detections.
* Developed and integrated Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer, improving IoU by 15%, with over 15k+ KITTI 3D samples.

## RoI Pooling
* The RoI Pooling layer aggregates features from the regions defined by the proposals.
* After pooling, a fully connected network or small CNN processes these pooled features for refined classification and regression.
**Input:** The feature map from the convolutional backbone and the 3D RoIs generated by the RPN.
**Grid Sampling:** Divide each 3D RoI into a fixed grid of sub-regions 
**Feature Pooling:** Extract features from the corresponding sub-regions in the voxel feature map using max pooling or average pooling.
**Output:** A fixed-size feature vector for each RoI.
